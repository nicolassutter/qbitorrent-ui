## Technologies Used

It was a SolidStart project but then I realized that the shadcn/ui port for SolidJS was not up to date compared to the original React version, so I decided to use React instead.

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Zustand**: For state management.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling.
- **Vite**: For fast development and build processes.
- **React Query**: For data fetching and caching.
- **shadcn/ui**: For accessible UI components.
- **Tanstack Router**: For routing.
